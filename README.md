relay-enhance-network-layer
==========

`DefaultNetworkLayer` adds some sugar like pretty formatting of errors and automatically resolving/rejecting query requests if there are errors.

This wraps the `sendQueries` and `sendMutations` of a Relay NetworkLayer in higher-order functions to bring them up to snuff with `DefaultNetworkLayer`.
